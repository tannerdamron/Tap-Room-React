## Description
This web application was built with React, and will allow the user, as a tap room employee, to view a list of available kegs and sell a pint or growler per keg. The user can also see the pints remaining in each keg. The user can add a new keg, tap any existing keg, and filter the kegs by style of beer or price per pint.
